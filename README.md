This repository will be used to hold scripts, write-ups and notes I collect during my self-study in pen-testing and red teaming.
My goal is to improve my personal skills in these areas, and more, to eventually switch into those industries.

These are my personal notes and scripts, there will likely be errors or omissions as I go. These should largely be tied to completed or on-going projects which can be found on my website: https://victoriamosby.com.

Cheers!
