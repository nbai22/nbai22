This repository holds scripts, write-ups and notes collected during my self-study in pen-testing and red teaming. My goal is to improve my skills and eventually transition into those industries.

These notes and scripts may contain errors or omissions as I learn. Most are tied to completed or on-going projects which can be found on my website: https://victoriamosby.com.

## Local site
The `thesmokingprinter-site/` folder contains a simple static site that will eventually host blog posts. To view it locally, open `index.html` in your browser:

```bash
cd thesmokingprinter-site
# then open index.html with your favorite browser
```

Cheers!
